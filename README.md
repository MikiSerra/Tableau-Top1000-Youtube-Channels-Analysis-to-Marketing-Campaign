The data was aggregated and processed for ease of visualization and insight extraction.

## Data Story Overview

### Identifying the Content of the Data Story:
The data story focuses on analyzing and comparing the engagement of YouTubers across different categories, without relying on a specific timeline. It explores how the most prominent YouTubers in each category vary based on their relative popularity and geographic location.

### Identifying the Style of the Story:
The storytelling style adopted is mainly "Comparison and Contrast," where differences in engagement among YouTuber categories are analyzed and highlighted without relying on a temporal flow, but rather based on their location within each continent.
